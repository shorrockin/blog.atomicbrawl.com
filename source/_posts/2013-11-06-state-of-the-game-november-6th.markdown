Another week, another weekly update. This week we talk a bit about our philosophy on how we balance, our new friends feature, sounds, leagues and cosplay.

## Balancing - Up Next!

A big balance pass is coming up next in the development queue. We have a few goals for this, but at a high level it's quite simple:

* Identify which cards/cores are under and over utilized.
* Determine which cards are too strong or weak in relation to their energy cost.

Balancing is a very tricky topic, and a tough intellectual exercise. Generally speaking we tend to be conservative with these things and would rather take many small steps than completely nerfing or buffing a card. There is currently some lively conversations over on our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atomicbrawl/">subreddit</a> for anyone who wants to weigh in on the topic.

## Friends - Now Available (_requires actual friends_)

Last night we launched our friends feature. With friends you can track the record of players you constantly play against, chat out of game, and view their profile. You can also view the profile of anyone you're playing a game with, or anyone on the leaderboards.

## Sounds - This Week

Sounds are pretty much all done! This includes both sound effects, and the voice over on the tutorial. The folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://powerupaudio.com/">Power Up Audio</a> are just cleaning some things up and then we'll release it onto the world. This should be ready this week, so keep your eyes and ears open.

## Leagues - Minor Change

We made a change to leagues so that we don't wind up with partially populated divisions. We will, for the short term, only have a single division per league. This means that if you were previously stuck in a 1/2 populated divisions, take another look - you should have some new friends to play with!

## Random Thing of the Week
