Anything of value has an inherent monetary equivalent. When you present someone with an item and offer it for free, it's not uncommon for them to think "what's the catch?". The psychology of free has been well documented, and in most cases "free" implies a level of quality that is not worth charging for. So how can you sell a free video game?

## Free is a Dirty Word

In the gaming industry, free-to-play (F2P) is a term that is fostering more and more negative connotations every day. These games are often viewed as a means to exploit players' emotional reactions. The experience starts free and fun, and when a player is hooked, they are either presented with a "pay wall" forcing them to pay or hit the road, or encounter game mechanics that slowly change until they are frustrated enough to spend money or leave (like the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog anecdote</a>). The financial success of these titles is immense, and there are plenty of new games released daily trying to cash in on this trend. The backlash against games that operate in this fashion is growing, and because of this, any game without an up-front cost triggers red flags for many gamers.

## Free is a Necessity... For Us

Before we launched <a href="http://atomicbrawl.com/">Atomic Brawl</a>, we had <em>many</em> conversations about how we were going to charge for the game, and eventually decided to make it free despite the growing backlash. Atomic Brawl is a multiplayer game - and as such - the fun is largely proportional to the number of people in the community. Our fear was that any up-front cost would limit our player base. Very few people would be willing to throw money at something they've never played or heard of, so we'd have a chicken-and-egg problem of not having enough opponents for the paying players. So we marched forward with a free game, and hoped that we could design a monetization system that <em>didn't</em> exploit our players. Our philosophy: no pay walls, no pay-only content, and most of all: <strong>fun for free forever!</strong>

## Free is Unproven

Is "free" a viable option for an indie game? An indie game that we'd like to see grow and develop into a long-term project? Atomic Brawl is proof that... we're not quite sure yet. We've been able to draw a very active and engaged community, but have not yet reached any sort of mainstream success. I believe that doubling down on our community engagement has been one of our better decisions. The number of people who really love what we've created has been validating (check out all the awesome reviews over at <a target=“_new” href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/atomic-brawl/jnpalbhkepkfjaobblnkadiccmffklpe/reviews?hl=en&gl=CA&authuser=0">the Chrome Web Store</a>).

## Free Requires Marketing

Up until now we've relied on grass roots marketing, and admittedly, probably not enough of it. We've been successful enough to prove that we've built something fun, but unfortunately we haven't yet reached a level of revenue to even sustain operating expenses for the game, let alone paying salaries or covering the development costs. Our next step is to march into more mainstream media circles and try to pique the interest of more gamers. With that goal in mind, we just completed our first trailer:

(SHAMELESS PLUG: please like, share, favourite, rub, comment, consume, and enjoy this)

With this trailer, we'll be making concerted effort to get more players to try the game. In doing so we hope to grow this game into an ever-evolving and exciting means to waste 5 minutes of your day, and prove that free-to-play games <em>can</em> be both sustainable and generous.

For the players who have been playing and loving Atomic Brawl over the past few months, we hope this effort give us enough traction to grow this into something you love even more.
