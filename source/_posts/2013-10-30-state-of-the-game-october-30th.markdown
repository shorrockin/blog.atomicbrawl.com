We'll let you in on a little secret. While we release these posts on Wednesdays, we actually write them Tuesday. This Tuesday however Ken and made our way to a local <a target=“_blank” href=“http://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Indie-Game-Developers/“>indie meetup</a> to socialize, drink and let some people play Atomic Brawl. With that in mind, this one will be brief (and late).

## Bleeps and Bloops

Sound effects are coming nearly done! The crew over at <a target="_blank" href="http://powerupaudio.com/">Power Up Audio</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/PowerUpAudio">@PowerUpAudio</a>) have been hard at work and are just putting the finishing touches on things. We think you’ll really like them when you hear them as they add a TON of depth. I would expect to see these launched this weekend.

## Voices in our Heads

Ken and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.makewordshappen.com/">Jacob Burgess</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CapnXez">@CapnXez</a>) recorded the voice over for the tutorial last Friday. The results are super awesome, and genuinely funny. We just need to choose what takes we want and toss them in the game. We’ll also get this done in the next few days.

## In Game Friends

The "Friends Feature" was coded last weekend. We just need to make sure it’s bug free and we’ll launch it. This feature adds a few new features:

* When you hover over your opponents avatar in game you can now see their casual or league record along with their deck name. Clicking on their avatar will take you to their public profile.
* Public profile will give you a brief breakdown on a user and let you see the details of the league they’ve been placed in.
* You can add a friend from a public profile page, or from the friends page.
* Once a friend is added the game will store your record against that specific player. This way you can always know how you’ve done against everyone on your friends list.

## Balancing Act

The next big thing we’ll focus on once we we the things above is launched is balance. Balance is a tricky topic, but we have a lot of feedback along with various stats that we can use to determine which cards are underpowered and which are overpowered. If you have any thoughts, please send us in-game feedback and we’ll incorporate your thoughts into the next balance pass.

## Random Thing of the Week

Last week we talked about Day[9]’s <a target="_blank" href="http://spellslingers.geekandsundry.com/">Spellslingers</a>.  There’s a new episode that just came out that is great. We still suggest all you MTG peeps check it out. It's still great.

As we said at the top of the post, we checked out a local indie meetup the other night. One of the talks was done by <a target="_blank" href="http://infiniteammo.com/">Alex Holowka</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/infinite_ammo">@infinite_ammo</a>). He spoke (and very well at that) about the his experiences in indie development and also presented his a trailer for his new game - <a href="http://www.nightinthewoods.com/" target="_blank">Night In The Woods</a>.

The game is currently being <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1307515311/night-in-the-woods" target="_blank">kickstarted</a> and looks awesome! We urge everyone to check it out.
