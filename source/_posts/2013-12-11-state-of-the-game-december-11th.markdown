Who's this shady "Ken" character, you ask? Why, it's me! Chris came down with the flu this week, so I'll be bringing you the State of the Game in his stead.

This week we cover the deck size changes, and some plans for getting more people into the land of Atomic Brawl.

## Deck Size Changes

As you probably noticed, we rolled out the changes to deck sizes that we previously mentioned. Decks changed from a 40-card minimum to 50, with a max of 3 of any card instead of 4. Feedback has been mixed on this one. We're convinced it will be good for the game long-term, as it'll help encourage variety, and mitigate totally broken combinations of cards (especially once we start rolling out expansion sets). Unfortunately, one big casualty was that combos balanced for the old deck sizes got much worse. We'll be tweaking combo cards over the next while to make them fun to play and build decks around, but not totally broken.

In that vein, one feature we're considering adding is a "search" card (likely modifying Stroke of Genius or Light Bulb), which would let you look at the top cards of your deck and choose some to keep. That would allow combo decks to go "hunting" for that last card they need.

## Trailer

We're still hard at work on a trailer, and that has taken up quite a bit of our time lately. The first draft is done, and we're working on sound for it and the final draft now. It should be ready sometime soon, hopefully in the next week or two.

## More Players!

Now that we're done that big tuning pass .... MORE PLAYERS
