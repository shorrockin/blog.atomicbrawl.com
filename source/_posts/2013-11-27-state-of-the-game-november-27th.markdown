You may of noticed the absence of the State of the Game last week. We've decided to move to a guaranteed State of the Game every two weeks. This should allow us to devote more time to development while hopefully still keeping everyone in the loop.

This week we cover the most recent patch, along with what didn't make it into the patch.

## The Balance Patch

The balance patch was launched last Sunday. For the most part, we feel we made a lot of good strides with this. The amount of feedback (both positive and negative) has been shocking! It's great that people are so passionate about the game!

We understand that not everything may be to everyone's liking. We also acknowledge that some of the changes we made may not be perfect. That said, there will be some _valid_ changes made that people don't like since it negatively effects their previous strategies. With this in mind, we'll look to closely over the next week to see what major misteps we took and look to correct them.

As always, any and all feedback is more than welcome, so keep it coming!

## Deck Sizes

We originally planned to include some changes to deck size in this release. However - there are some complications so we decided to get the balance patch out first, then worry deal with this.

The intent of this change is to force more deck variety, which should lead to a more interesting and diverse game.

Currently, we have a minimum deck size of 40 cards, with no more than 4 copies of a single card. We are considering moving to a 50 card minimum with a maxmium of 3 cards of any one card.

There are quite a few reasons for doing this, however, the obvious one is that it forces people to be more creative in their deck building and helps ensure that decks have more variety to them, which should result in a more interesting - and strategic - game. 

That's all for this week!
