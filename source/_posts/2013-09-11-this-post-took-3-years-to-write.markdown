Three(<em>ish</em>) years agos we began working on <a href="http://atomicbrawl.com">Atomic Brawl</a>. Two years ago we thought “maybe we can launch this Christmas”. One(<em>ish</em>) year ago, we thought we would launch in the summer. 

Making software is difficult. Making software whose objective is as abstract as fun compounds that.

Last Sunday, we launched <a href="http://atomicbrawl.com">Atomic Brawl</a>. <a href="http://atomicbrawl.com">Atomic Brawl</a> is an in-browser strategy game where you can take turns in bite-sized chunks, allowing it to fit into <em>any schedule</em>.  You collect brawlers, formulate strategies, and compete online against other players.

### As Time Past

Three years is a long time to commit to anything. Both of us having day jobs meant that free time was almost always spent on the project. Over these three years we:

* Had 1,867,713 additions, 1,748,514 deletions and 4,923 project commits.
* Had 10,557 games played, with 1,646,689 brawlers killed in action.
* Introduced a third partner, then watched, as he left to do fantastic work on Sim City 5.
* Saw my youngest daughter learn to speak properly, read, write, finish kindergarten, and start grade 1.
* Had amazing support from our families and loved ones who supported us unconditionally.

### Take Aways

I believe both of us would've thrown our hands in the air and moved onto something else if it wasn't for a few key things:

* <strong>Like who you work with</strong>: In life, and in business, surrounding yourself with people you enjoy makes difficult times easy.
* <strong>Argue well</strong>: Keep emotions out of arguments. Understand that you have the same objective with differing opinions on how to get there.
* <strong>Get feedback early</strong>: We've been in beta for the last year. We've been playable for much longer. Fun is a subjective term, having people play and provide feedback was key to crystallizing our vision.
* <strong>Be a servant</strong>: You should do anything you can to <em>help</em> and <em>respect</em> your users. In doing so you'll develop friendships and relationships that will help you for years to come.
* <strong>Work your strengths</strong>: Understand what you are, and are not, good at - optimize around this. Trade favours (or cash) for things you need help with. Don't waste hours hours on something someone else can do in minutes. <em>Value your time</em>.

### Starting Again

For most games this post would be a post-mortem, marking the end of a journey - for us, this marks the beginning. As a free online product we need to work hard on live-support, marketing, and growth, in addition to development, so that we can turn this into a sustainable venture.  

If failure does happen, we'll be happy having known that we went from nothing to something, without compromising our vision, and took a shot at something we were <em>passionate</em> about.
