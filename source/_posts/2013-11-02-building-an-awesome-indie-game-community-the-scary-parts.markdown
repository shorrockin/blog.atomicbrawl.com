When Ken and I started Atomic Brawl we had a lot of discussion about the type of game we wanted to build. This of course including mechanics, art, and things of that nature - but it also included what we wanted the game to become.

Throughout development this vision became more clear. We wanted to build a game that people loved. We wanted to build a game that people obsessed over. We wanted to build a community.

<!-- more -->

We work hard with our players to make them feel part of the team. We value their opinions, and utilize them to produce the best product we can. It's our hope that by respecting and valuing their thoughts and opinions we can realize our goal.

With that said, something truly scary happened this Halloween. Something I never anticipated when I started this game. Unfortunately it all started with some deceit from my co-founder:

Like most lies, it wasn't long before the dirty little secret came bubbling up. In my inbox, the duplicitous nature was presented to me as an attachment.

The previous night co-founder had attended a "You Just Turned 30 / It's Halloween - So We All Secretly Dress Up Like Characters From Your Indie Game" party:

I really didn't anticipate cosplay so close to launch! But man, these pictures blew me away. For this, as so many more reasons, our community is amazing!
